# C Programs Collection

This repository consists of various C programs that demonstrate basic to intermediate level concepts in the C programming language.

---

## üìò About

These programs illustrate key concepts such as:

* Control structures (loops, conditionals)
* Functions and recursion
* Pointers and dynamic memory
* String manipulation and file handling
* Mathematical and logical operations
* Data handling and simulation (e.g., billing system, student info)

Each `.c` file is independently runnable and focuses on a specific task or concept.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* C Compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `clang`)
* Command-line terminal or IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Turbo C, Dev C++, VS Code)
